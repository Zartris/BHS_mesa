# Bag Handling System Mesa Simulation for Airport Logistics

## Overview
Provide a brief overview of what the project does and what problem it solves.

## Table of Contents
Include a table of contents to help users navigate your README file.

## MESA Framework
The Bag Handling System Mesa Simulation for Airport Logistics is based on the MESA framework. MESA is a Python-based agent-based modeling framework that allows users to create simulations of complex systems, such as traffic flow, supply chains, and social networks. MESA provides a set of tools and libraries for building, analyzing, and visualizing agent-based models, including a visualization module based on the Pygame library.

MESA is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to easily add new agents, behaviors, and environmental factors to their simulations. It is also designed to be scalable, allowing users to run simulations on a single machine or distribute them across a cluster of machines for faster processing.

The Bag Handling System Mesa Simulation for Airport Logistics uses the MESA framework's multi-grid world as its space module, which allows for multiple agents to be positioned in the same grid tile. This was chosen to ensure robots can be positioned on inchute and charging tiles.
